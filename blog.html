Over the years in which I have been making music I have gone about making beats in multiple ways. This process has led me to now use either one of two methods.</div>

<br /></div>
<div class="p1" style="background-color: white; color: #02050e; font-family: Poppins, Helvetica, sans-serif; margin-bottom: 20px;">
Method one - The loop method</div>
<br style="background-color: white; color: #02050e; font-family: Poppins, Helvetica, sans-serif;" />
<div class="p1" style="background-color: white; color: #02050e; font-family: Poppins, Helvetica, sans-serif; margin-bottom: 20px;">
With this method you start the beat by creating a simple loop between 8 - 16 bars long. You can start with any instrument you like but personally I like to start with a melodic sample or play in a phrase via a synth. Once you have something you like, just keep adding more layers until you've built up a full sounding loop. I like to add a lot of layers to the point where I have too much. Better to have too much to work with than not enough. As I'm adding layers I will listen to how well the instrument blends with what's already there. This way when it comes to mixing, everything should already be blending together fairly well.</div>
<div class="p1" style="background-color: white; color: #02050e; font-family: Poppins, Helvetica, sans-serif; margin-bottom: 20px;">
The next step is to take your loop and start structuring it out into a song. Essentially you just spread out all the parts and bring instruments in gradually.</div>
<div class="p1" style="background-color: white; color: #02050e; font-family: Poppins, Helvetica, sans-serif; margin-bottom: 20px;">
The final stage is to listen back to your structure and make adjustments and tweaks. You may want to add in details such as drum fills and changes to individual instrument loops to add variety and development. This is necessary so the song doesn't get boring over time. Obviously you'll have to keep listening to it through and make adjustments where you see fit.</div>

This method will obviously work better for Hip Hop type beats and other styles that focus around a loop. If you want to make something with multiple sections then method two may be a better way to go.</div>

<div class="p1" style="background-color: white; color: #02050e; font-family: Poppins, Helvetica, sans-serif; margin-bottom: 20px;">
Method Two - The main line method</div>
<br style="background-color: white; color: #02050e; font-family: Poppins, Helvetica, sans-serif;" />
<div class="p1" style="background-color: white; color: #02050e; font-family: Poppins, Helvetica, sans-serif; margin-bottom: 20px;">
With this method your goal is to set out the main structure with one instrument straight away. This method is great for genre types that revolve less around a loop and more around a classic song structure Usually I will use either a guitar or keyboard to write the main line. A basic song structure could contain 3 parts. For example: verse, chorus and bridge. When writing the different sections you should think about dynamics. The verses will want to be quieter than the chorus etc. Once you have your main line you can start to add in the other instruments. It should now be easy to write the other parts as they can feed off your main lines dynamics and rhythms. The advantage with this method is your song structure is finished right from the start. Often when I’m using the ‘loop’ method I will get stuck with the structure and not know where to take a song.&nbsp;</div>

Conclusion</div>
<div class="p1" style="background-color: white; color: #02050e; font-family: Poppins, Helvetica, sans-serif; margin-bottom: 20px;">
In the real world there are obviously other ways you can go about writing music but when it comes down to it these tend to be my go too’s. The important thing when choosing which method will work best is to think about what kind of song you wish to write and what will be the easiest way to achieve this.&nbsp;</div>
